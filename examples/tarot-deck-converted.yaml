# Key differences from old format:
#
# 1. suit_element, suit_color, suit_theme are now metadata (appended to prompts)
#    Old: Hard-coded special fields
#    New: Generic metadata that enhances prompts
#
# 2. Hierarchical structure with subgroups
#    Old: Flat structure (major_arcana, minor_arcana.wands, etc.)
#    New: Nested groups and subgroups
#
# 3. Explicit filenames
#    Old: Generated from number/rank and name
#    New: Specified in the YAML (more control)
#
# 4. Metadata inheritance
#    Old: Each card standalone
#    New: Common metadata defined once at group level
#
# Example of how metadata gets applied:
#   Base prompt: "single upright wand with leaves sprouting..."
#   + Group metadata: "art nouveau style, ornate border, tarot card art"
#   + Subgroup metadata: "fire, red, creativity and passion"
#   = Final prompt: "single upright wand with leaves sprouting..., art nouveau style, ornate border, tarot card art, fire, red, creativity and passion"
