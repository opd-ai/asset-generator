## Requirements

All examples require:
- `asset-generator` CLI installed and configured
- Asset generation service running (default: http://localhost:7801)
- POSIX-compliant shell (bash, dash, zsh)
- Basic utilities (wget, zip, etc.)

**Note:** Previous examples may have required `yq` for YAML parsing, but the new native `pipeline` command eliminates this dependency. Shell scripts in examples are now simple wrappers around the pipeline command.

See individual example READMEs for specific requirements.
